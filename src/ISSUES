Changes made when modifying event or transition are not reflected to neighbouring events and transitions.
Need to rewrite EventSelector constructors and Model#getSelected (and some other procedures of Selectors)

What happened to derivative?

Weird behaviour of transitions. Take one transition and drag from other place than selector point; still selected but delete button flashes off.

As a whole, the system seems to require a complete rework. :-/
