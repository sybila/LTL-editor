/**
 * Interface for manipulating graphical primitives. Generally comprises active points (aka green squares).
 * When active components are dragged, selected primitive is transformed, when area of primitive but not
 * active points are dragged, primitive is moved.
 * 
 * Created in the moment of selecting a primitive, destroyed when unselecting it. Significant change
 * of primitive may cause it to be reloaded (i.e. is reloaded after each {@link #endDrag(MouseEvent)}).
 * 
 * Manipulates with on-screen coordinates.
 * 
 * When a primitive is selected, its drawing is managed by the selector.
